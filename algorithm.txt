1. Initialization:

Include necessary header files for input/output (iostream), vectors (vector), lists (list), math functions (cmath), time-related functions (ctime), and random number generation (cstdlib).
Define a structure EntryGateQueue to represent an entry gate queue with two fields:

attendees: A linked list to store attendee IDs in the queue.
estimatedWaitTime: An integer representing the estimated wait time for the last person in the queue (in minutes).

Define a function estimateWaitTime that takes the queue length and processing time per attendee as input and returns the estimated wait time (queue length * processing time).
