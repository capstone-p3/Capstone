algorithm for the problem.


Entry Gate Queue: 
This can be thought as a line of people waiting to get into a venue. Each entry gate has its own line.
As new people arrive, they choose the queue with the shortest waiting time (calculated based on the number of people already in the queue).


Main Function:

People tell us how many gates there are, how many people are coming, and how quickly each person can enter.
We set up lines at each gate.
A function will choose random gates for new arrivel attendees.
