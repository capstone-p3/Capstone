 PROJECT - 3. ENTRY QUEUE MANAGER

/****   You need to build an entry queue manager for a stadium. There are N entry gates. As people keep coming in, they can line up in any
 of the queues or switch queues anytime if they think that will get them a quicker entry. The entry queue manager helps them in making
 that decision by suggesting:
 
(i) the waiting time for the last person in the queue to enter through any gate (assume that it takes p mins for a single attendee to enter any gate).

(ii) the particular queue number(s) where one should be switching.

The queue manager must be designed to minimize the time it takes for M people to enter the stadium. Each gate has an initial random assignment of M/2 
people (a gate may not have anyone assigned).     ********/
